### Hi there, I'm Gastón 👋

I'm a Computer Engineer from Uruguay that lived and worked in Ireland and France for the past years. Now back in Uruguay :)

In my free time I like to read books 📖, listen (and occasionally play) music 🎶, and travel 🗺️

I've been doing back-end development in Node.js for a while in diverse areas including fintech, gaming, and blockchain

Currently preparing the OSCP exam! 👨‍💻
