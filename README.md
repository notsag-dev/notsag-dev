### Hi there, I'm Gastón 👋

I'm a Computer Engineer from Uruguay

I lived and worked in Ireland 🍀 and France 🥖 for the past years. Now I'm back in Uruguay :)

I've been doing back-end development in Node.js for a while in diverse areas including fintech, gaming, and blockchain

In my free time I like to read books 📖, listen to (and occasionally play) music 🎶, and travel 🗺️

Currently preparing the OSCP exam! 👨‍💻
